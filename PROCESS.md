* Created a navigation bar which works

#### Thursday, 10 January
Finished the Design Document:

* Website now also contains a pie chart (without legend)

#### Friday, 11 January
Slow day with not as much progress as I would have liked. Mentor meeting in the afternoon. The rest of my group is a lot further than I am. I need to work a bit faster.

#### Monday, 14 January
The legend of the pie chart is visible! I also started on my line graph. The axes are in place, but the data points are all on the same y-level. Will work on fixing this first thing in the morning tomorrow. Hopefully the line graph will be complete by the end of tomorrow.

#### Tuesday, 15 January
The line graph looks good and is showing all the data that it is supposed to show. Nothing is linked yes, I will start working on this once all individual visualizations are finished. I made a start on the bar chart, but nothing is showing yet in the browser. I will work on this more this evening. I also need to start thinking about how I will use functions. Got some tips form teammates, but still need to work this out for myself and perhaps ask some help from a tutor.

#### Wednesday, 16 January
Tried to work on functions, this didn't really work out. Will seek help for this later. Made some progress on the data for the bar chart.

#### Thursday, 17 January
At the end of the I finally have axes and some bars! Very happy with this result. Hopefully, by the end of tomorrow I will be able to show all three categories in the bar chart (now only 1 category is visible).

#### Friday, 18 January
I'm still having some problems with the bar chart. I need to figure out how to make a variable (el) global. I did make some steps in the right direction and I'm hoping that the bar chart will be working well by the end of Monday. I will spend some hours on the bar chart this weekend and try to get as far as possible and be ready on Monday with some concrete questions.

#### Monday, 21 January
The bar chart is working! I also made 2 of the 3 linked views. When the big pie chart is clicked on, two new pie charts show on the screen. The third linked view I hope to have finished by the end of the week.

#### Tuesday, 22 January
Today I got some 'bad' news. I forgot about 'grouping' my bar chart. The example that I used for my code was a grouped bar chart, but for some reason the grouping isn't happening in my chart. My project isn't complex enough if the bar chart isn't grouped. I'll have to make the bar chart all over again, because it's going to be too complicated to change the bar chart into a grouped bar chart.

#### Wednesday, 23 January
Today I wasn't feeling well and decided to stay home. I tried to work on my bar chart in the evening but didn't really manage.

#### Thursday, 24 January
Hackathon day. I wasn't able to ask any questions. I really need some help.

#### Friday, 25 January
The bar chart still isn't finished by the end of today. I'm getting worried. I also still need to complete the third linked view... Hopefully I'll figure out the bar chart by myself during the weekend.

#### Weekend 26, 27 January
I managed to get the new grouped bar chart working with D3 V4, which isn't ideal but good enough. I'm very happy about this. Now I need to work on the dropdown menu in the line graph. The dropdown menu exists, it just doesn't create the lines when clicked on yet.

#### Monday, 28 January
I managed to make a line appear when the dropdown menu is clicked on, although at the end of the day I noticed that the line is moved up. I tried to figure this at home in the evening and finally realized it was because of the scale. Now the lines at the right data points. Tomorrow I will work on giving each line its own color and adding circles to the 2 added lines.

#### Tuesday, 29 January
Each line in the line graph has its own color and has circles at every data point. It's possible to hover over the circles in order to see what the exact value is at that point. Today I also cerated my LICENSE.md and changed the background color of my website.

#### Wednesday, 30 January
The Facts page and Contact page are finished. I wrote my README.md. I made some small aesthetic changes to my website.
