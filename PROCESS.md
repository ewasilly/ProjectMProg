#### Wednesday, 9 January
Working on the Design Document:

* Created a navigation bar which works

#### Thursday, 10 January
Finished the Design Document:

* Website now also contains a pie chart (without legend)

#### Friday, 11 January
Slow day with not as much progress as I would have liked. Mentor meeting in the afternoon. The rest of my group is a lot further than I am. I need to work a bit faster.

#### Monday, 14 January
The legend of the pie chart is visible! I also started on my line graph. The axes are in place, but the datapoints are all on the same y-level. Will work on fixing this first thing in the morning tomorrow. Hopefully the line graph will be complete by the end of tomorrow.

#### Tuesday, 15 January
The line graph looks good and is showing all the data that it is supposed to show. Nothing is linked yes, I will start working on this once all individual visualizations are finished. I made a start on the bar chart, but nothing is showing yet in the browser. I will work on this more this evening. I also need to start thinking about how I will use functions. Got some tips form teammates, but still need to work this out for myself and perhaps ask some help from a tutor.
